I've measured using Behringer U-phoria UMC22 with Maono AU-PM320S.

For echo suppression, a pillow fort had been erected. ![Alt text](../images/sweep2.jpg)

Calibration was performed on a laminated chipboard table.

I've used HiFiScan to collect the measurements.

Measurements on a more professional equipment would be a welcome addition.
